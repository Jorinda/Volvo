				<h2> Volvo Group: Not only cars.  </h2>
				<p> 
					(This article is about the Volvo Group (AB Volvo). For the separate manufacturer of passenger vehicles, see Volvo Cars. For other uses, see Volvo (disambiguation).) The Volvo Group (Swedish: Volvokoncernen; legally Aktiebolaget Volvo, shortened to AB Volvo) (stylised as VOLVO) is a Swedish multinational manufacturing company headquartered in Gothenburg. While its core activity is the production, distribution and sale of trucks, buses and construction equipment, Volvo also supplies marine and industrial drive systems and financial services. Although the two firms are still often conflated, Volvo Cars, also based in Gothenburg, has been a totally separate company since it was sold to the Ford Motor Company in 1999. The companies still share the Volvo logo and co-operate in running the Volvo Museum. Volvo was established in 1915 as a subsidiary of SKF, the ball bearing manufacturer; however the Volvo Group and Volvo Cars consider themselves to have been officially founded on 14 April 1927, when the first car, the Volvo ÖV 4 series, affectionately known as "Jakob", rolled out of the factory in Hisingen, Gothenburg. The building remains (57°42′50″N 11°55′19″E﻿ / ﻿57.71389°N 11.92194°E). Volvo means "I roll" in Latin, conjugated from "volvere", in reference to ball bearings. The brand name Volvo was originally registered as a trademark in May 1911 with the intention to be used for a new series of SKF ball bearings. This idea was only used for a short period and SKF decided to simply use "SKF" as the trademark for all its bearing products. In 1924, Assar Gabrielsson, an SKF sales manager, and engineer Gustav Larson, the two founders, decided to start construction of a Swedish car. Their vision was to build cars that could withstand the rigors of the country's rough roads and cold temperatures. AB Volvo began activities on 10 August 1926. After one year of preparations involving the production of ten prototypes the firm was ready to commence the car-manufacturing business within the SKF group. AB Volvo was introduced at the Stockholm stock exchange in 1935 and SKF then decided to sell its shares in the company. Volvo was delisted from NASDAQ in June 2007, but remains listed on the Stockholm Stock exchange.

				<h2> Volvo Cars  </h2>
				<p> 
					Volvo Car Corporation (Swedish: Volvo personvagnar) (stylized as VOLVO) is a Swedish luxury vehicle manufacturer established in 1927 and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, where it operates out of the VAK building. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group of China. Volvo Car Corporation was originally founded as a subsidiary of the ball bearing maker SKF. When Volvo AB was introduced on the Swedish stock exchange in 1935, SKF sold most of the shares in the company. Volvo Cars was owned by AB Volvo until 1999, when it was acquired by the Ford Motor Company as part of its Premier Automotive Group. Geely Holding Group then acquired Volvo Cars from Ford in 2010. Volvo Cars manufactures and markets sport utility vehicles, station wagons, sedans, compact executive sedans, and coupes. With approximately 2,300 local dealers from around 100 national sales companies worldwide, Volvo Cars' largest markets are the United States, Sweden, China and Belgium. In 2011, Volvo Cars sold 449,255 cars globally, an increase of 20.3% compared to 2010. In its home country, Sweden, Volvo holds the number one place in terms of sales with over 71,000 units sold in 2015
